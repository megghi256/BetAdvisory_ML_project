# BetAdvisory_ML_project
This project simulates a bet advisory service using machine learning to predict football match outcomes across European leagues. Users choose a risk profile (safe to risky), and receive weekly predictions. The project evaluates prediction accuracy and potential returns, using Random Forest and XGBoost models trained on historical data.
